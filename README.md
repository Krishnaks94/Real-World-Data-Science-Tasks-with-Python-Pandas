# Real-world-data-science-tasks-with-Python-Pandas-as-Sales-Analysis

## Sales Analysis
### Objective
To analyze sales data using Python Pandas by merging multiple datasets, cleaning the data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover insights related to sales trends, city performance, optimal advertising times, and frequently sold product combinations.

### Problem Statement
The project involves analyzing sales data from multiple CSV files to:
1. Combine the data into a single dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Perform exploratory analysis to answer specific business questions.
4. Visualize insights to aid in decision-making.

### Process
1. Import Necessary Libraries.
2. Merge the 12 Months of Sales Data.
3. Clean the Data.
4. Augment Data with Additional Columns: 
   1). Add Month Column.
   2). Add Sales Column.
   3). Add City Column.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis: 
   Question 1: Best Month for Sales.
   Question 2: City with Highest Sales.
   Question 3: Optimal Advertising Times.
   Question 4: Products Most Often Sold Together.
   Question 5: Most Sold Products.
### Conclusion:
The analysis demonstrates key insights:

Best Sales Month: Visualize sales by month to determine the peak sales period.
Top City for Sales: Identify which city generated the highest revenue.
Optimal Advertising Times: Recommend times to maximize customer engagement.
Frequent Product Combinations: Discover which products are commonly purchased together.
Most Sold Products: Analyze sales and pricing trends for different products.
